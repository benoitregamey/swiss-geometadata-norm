# Swiss Geometadata Norm
Useful information for the future of the swiss geometadata norm.
### GM03 Medium
The GM03 Medium norm is the current norm for swiss geometadata. It is a subset of useful attributes from the last GM03 v.2.3 (2005) 
norm with an addition to describe geoservices.

To have a good basis to discuss the future of the swiss geometadata norm, we've conducted a study to analyse 
the usage of the GM03 Medium norm, namely to have a list of attributes and to know how they are used. [GM03 Medium Analyse](./Analyse-GM03-Medium)
